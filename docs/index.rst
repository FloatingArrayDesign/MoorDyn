Welcome to MoorDyn's (UNDER CONSTRUCTION) online documentation.
See the pages on this site for information about the operation,
:ref:`usage <usage>`, and :ref:`theory <theory>` of MoorDyn.

Note: This documentation is meant for users, a
`Doxygen documentation <./doxygen/index.html>`_ has been deployed for the
developers.

About MoorDyn
-------------

MoorDyn is a simple, efficient, and versatile mooring system dynamics model
designed to work  in concert with other simulation tools. It is based on a
lumped-mass discretization of a  mooring line's dynamics, and adds point-mass
and rigid-body objects to enable simulation of a wide variety of mooring and
cabling arrangements. Hydrodynamics are included using a version of the Morison
equation.

There are three main forms. Version 1 (MoorDyn V1) is coded in C++, is very easy to couple with
a variety of models and programming languages, and is released under the GPL. It is 
the original form of the model, and it is used with WEC-Sim, DualSPHysics, and 
various :ref:`wrappers in different languages <wrappers>`.

Version 2 (MoorDynV2) is also coded in C++. It is an updated version of v1 and contains all the orginal 
features with some new addtions. It contains wrappers that make it available as a python library and allows
it to be easily packaged into other languages. It is released under the `3-clause BSD license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_. 

The third form is MoorDynF, a full rewrite of MoorDyn in FORTRAN that follows
the FAST Modularization Framework. This form is a core module in the OpenFAST
floating wind turbine simulator.

Both forms of MoorDyn have the same underlying physics model, and nearly
identical input file formats.

This website serves as a public-facing guide for MoorDyn in all forms. It focuses on MoorDynâ€™s principles 
of operation, setup of the input files, common problems, etc. It will also have guidance for coupling with 
MoorDyn in standalone form, as well as a guide for the API. For information about use of MoorDyn-F in the 
larger context of OpenFAST simulations, refer also to the `OpenFAST documentation <https://openfast.readthedocs.io>`_.

The MoorDyn source code is available on GitHub. The standalone C++ code is
`here <https://github.com/mattEhall/MoorDyn>`_ and
code of MoorDyn-F in FORTRAN is available within the
`OpenFAST repository <https://github.com/openfast/openfast>`_.
