Features and References
=======================
.. _theory:

Most of MoorDyn’s theory is described in the following publications. This page 
gives a very high-level overview, highlights specific theory aspects that may 
be important to users, and lists the papers where more detail can be found.

Features
--------

Version 1
^^^^^^^^^
MoorDyn is based on a lumped-mass discretization of a mooring line’s dynamics, and adds point-mass and rigid-body objects to enable simulation of a wide 
variety of mooring and cabling arrangements. Hydrodynamics are included using a version of the Morison equation.

Version 2
^^^^^^^^^
MoorDyn v2 contains all the features of v1 with the following additional features:
  - Simulation of 6 degree of freedom objects
  - Non-linear tension
  - Wave kinematics
  - Bending stiffness
  - Bathymetry
  - Seabed friction

The main difference between MoorDyn-C and MoorDyn-F is that MoorDyn-C uses quaternions to describe the orientation of 6DOF objects, while F uses traditional Euler angles to handle 6DOF object rotations.

Orientation of 6 DOF objects:

Euler angles – MoorDyn-F
""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the following figure the 6DOF object orientation angles convention is depicted:

.. figure:: angles.svg
   :alt: Angles criteria schematic view

The roll and yaw angles, :math:`\phi` and :math:`\psi`, follow the
right hand criteria, while the pitch angle, :math:`\theta`, follows the left
hand criteria.
This way the classic rotation matrices can be considered,

.. math::
   \begin{alignat}{1}
   R_x(\phi) &= \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &  0         &  0           \\
   0 &  \cos \phi & -\sin \phi \\[3pt]
   0 &  \sin \phi & \cos \phi \\[3pt]
   \end{bmatrix} \\[6pt]
   R_y(\theta) &= \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos \theta & 0 & \sin \theta \\[3pt]
   0           & 1 &  0           \\[3pt]
   -\sin \theta & 0 &  \cos \theta \\
   \end{bmatrix} \\[6pt]
   R_z(\psi) &= \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos \psi & -\sin \psi & 0 \\[3pt]
   \sin \psi &  \cos \psi & 0 \\[3pt]
   0         &  0         & 1 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
   \end{alignat}


Quaternions – MoorDyn-C
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The latest MoorDyn-C internally uses quaternions to describe the location and orientation of 6 DOF objects. Externally MoorDyn-C behaves the same as MoorDyn-F, using Euler angles for both inputs and outputs. Quaternions are a common alternative to Euler angles for describing orientations of 3D objects. 
Further description of quaternions can be found in PR #90 in the MoorDyn repository, put together by Alex Kinley of Kelson Marine: https://github.com/FloatingArrayDesign/MoorDyn/pull/90#issue-1777700494
