Model Structure
===============
.. _structure:

MoorDyn v2 models the dynamics of mooring structures in an object-oriented approach. There are four 
main object types: Lines, Points, Rods, and Bodies. MoorDyn v1 only contained Lines and Points. 
Lines are the fundamental discretized lumped-mass modeling component. Points and Rods provide a 
means of connecting lines with additional 3- and 6-DOF properties (respectively), and Bodies 
provide a way to create more complex 6-DOF rigid-body assemblies. These objects have predefined 
ways or interacting. Kinematics are passed from the top down in and are used to calculate the 
forces which are passed up back to the outside program or to output channels. This hierarchy is 
shown below:

   :alt: MoorDyn object hierarchy 

Each object type and its key parameters are detailed in the following sections.

Note: The variables described below are for MoorDyn-C. MoorDyn-F has the same general structure as 
MoorDyn-C, with similar variables. The biggest difference between the codes underlying modeling is 
that in MoorDyn-C quaternions are used to describe the position and orientation of 6DOF objects, 
while in MoorDyn-F traditional Euler angles are used. To read more about quaternions and their 
implementation, refer to the :ref:`theory section <theory>`.

Lines
-----
.. _lines:

MoorDyn uses a lumped-mass approach to discretize the dynamics over the length of the mooring line.  
A line is broken up into N evenly sized line segments connecting N+1 node points. The indexing 
starts at the anchor (or lower end), with the anchor node given a value of zero, and the cable 
segment between nodes 0 and 1 given an index of 1/2.
 
The model uses a right-handed inertial reference frame with the z axis being measured positive up 
from the water plane, consistent with NREL’s FAST simulator.  Each node’s position is defined by a 
vector r.  Each segment of the cable has identical properties of unstretched length, diameter, 
density, and Young's modulus.  Different cables can have different sets of properties, and cables 
can be connected together at the ends, enabling mooring systems with interconnected lines. 

Hydrodynamic loads are calculated directly at the node points rather than at the segment centers. 
This ensures damping of transverse cable vibrations having a wavelength of twice the cable segment 
length. To approximate the cable direction at the node points, the cable tangent at each node is 
assumed to be the average of the tangent directions of the two adjacent cable elements. Aside from 
this detail, the formulation of the mooring model is fairly standard. Further technical details and 
validation results are available in the :ref:`theory section <theory>`.

Bending stiffness is a recent capability addition in MoorDyn-C (it is not yet implemented in 
MoorDyn-F). The word cable is used to refer to a Line object with nonzero bending stiffness.

MoorDyn reads a user defined table of line types from the input file to describe the 
cross-sectional (or per-meter) properties of the mooring lines. Each line type has an alphanumeric 
name to identify it and contains all the properties aside from length and discretization that are 
needed to describe a mooring line in MoorDyn.

Points
------
.. _points:

Point objects attach to the ends of Lines and can be used to connect Lines to other things
or to each other. (In MAP and older versions of MoorDyn, these objects were called Connections or 
Nodes). A Point has three degrees of freedom and can have any number of Lines attached to it. There 
are three types of Points:

- **Fixed/Anchor/Body**: their location is fixed to an XYZ coordinate (stationary) or a XYZ 
  coordinate in the Body reference frame. They can be used as anchor points or to attach mooring 
  lines to a Body.
- **Coupled/Vessel**: they move under the control of the driver program/script.  
  They can be used as fairlead points when the platform is modeled externally.
  See :ref:`the coupling documentation <coupling>`.
- **Free/Point**: they are free to move according to the forces acting on them, which 
  includes the tensions of attached lines as well as their own self weight and buoyancy, if 
  applicable.  

Free Points facilitate more advanced mooring systems. They can be used to connect two 
or more mooring lines together, to create multi-segmented lines or junctions such as in a 
bridle mooring configuration. If a free Point is given nonzero volume or mass properties,
it can also represent a clump weight or float. 

In MoorDyn-C, "Points" are represented as Point objects.
Currently, every line must have 2
points at each endpoint (Rod ends serve as points). Point objects expose a public member, 
Point::attachment, that contains 1) a pointer to the Line object attached to the point and 2) a 
field indicating which "end" (A or B) of the line is attached to the point.

Points Objects have the following variables:

General:

- *env*: a pointer to a global struct holding environmental settings
- *waves*: a pointer to a global object representing Waves in the system
- *t*: the simulation time, as a real
- *seafloor*: a pointer to the global object storing the 3d seafloor information

..

Rods 
----
.. _rods:

Rod objects provide an option for rigid cylindrical elements within a mooring system. They have 
similar modeling details as Lines except for their rigidity, which gives them six degrees of 
freedom. Like Lines, they are divided into nodes at which weight, buoyancy, seabed contact, and 
Morison-based hydrodynamic forces are calculated. Unlike Lines, their internal forces are not 
calculated. Generally, more nodes in a rod increase the accuracy of rod dynamics calculations. The 
end nodes of a rod are available for attachment of lines (specified as "R2A" for end A of Rod 2) 
and can be set up in the :ref:`input file <v2_inputs>`.

Rods can have 6, 3, or 0 DOF. 

- **Fixed**: Rods are full constrained, and their movement is defined by that of a body, the ground, 
  or a coupling point (0 DOF). 
- **Coupled**: They move under the control of the calling program/script (constrained in all 6 DOF).
  See :ref:`the coupling documentation <coupling>`.
- **Free**: Rods are unconstrained to move in all 6 DOF.  
- **Pinned**: The rod end A translational movement is fixed while the rotational movement about end A is free.
- **Coupled pinned**: The rod end A translational movement is coupled while the rotational movement about end A is free.

Pinned or Fixed Rods attached to a body (e.g. body 1) are labelled "Body1Pinned" or "Body1". 
Rods attached to bodies have their coordinates defined in the body reference frame
Pinned or fixed rods that serve as a coupling point are labelled "CoupledPinned" or "Coupled".

A special case exists if a Rod is specified with zero elements: in that case it is given zero 
length, and its end B coordinates in the input file are instead interpreted as vector components to 
describe its direction vector. This case is meant for making cantilever points of a line with 
bending stiffness. A fixed zero-length rod can be used to make a cantilever point of a power cable 
to the ground, a body, or a coupling point. A free zero-length rod can be used to join two 
different types of power cable segments, and it will pass moments between the cable segments 
without adding any mass or other characteristics.

- *env*: a pointer to a global struct holding environmental settings

Bodies
------
.. _bodies:

Body objects provide a generic 6 DOF rigid-body representation based on a lumped-parameter model of 
translational and rotational properties (e.g. hydrodynamic drag and added mass coefficients). Rod 
elements can be added to bodies and mooring lines can be attached at any location, allowing a wide 
variety of submerged structures to be integrated into the mooring system. The body itself does not 
have a defined geometry (the volume is only used in buoyancy calculations), rather its geometry is 
defined by the rods attached to it. Therefore, for simplicity, any hydrodynamic loads associated 
with a body on its own (with no attached objects) are always calculated as though the body is fully 
submerged. Partial submergence is handled in any attached objects. Aside from contributions which 
might come from incorporated Rod objects or attached Point and Line objects, the core Body object 
properties are as follows:

- *mass, and center of mass*
- *volumetric displacement (assumed to be at reference point)*
- *mass moment of inertia about each axis*
- *hydrodynamic drag coefficient in each direction*
- *rotational hydrodynamic drag coefficient about each axis*
- *added mass coefficient in each direction*
- *added mass moment of inertia coefficient about each axis*

There are three possible types 
for bodies:

- **Free**: the body kinematics are computed by MoorDyn based on the applied loads and inertia
- **Fixed**: the body is fixed, either to a particular location or to a connected, moving entity.
- - **Coupled**: the body kinematics are controlled by the calling program.
- **Coupled pinned**: The body's translational movement is coupled while the rotational movement is free.

Body objects have the following variables:

General:

- *env*: a pointer to a global struct holding environmental settings
- *waves*: a pointer to a global object representing Waves in the system

Attachments:

- *attachedP*: a vector of pointers to point objects, indicating all the points attached to the 
  body
- *attachedR*: a vector of pointers to Rod objects attached to the body. 
- *rPointRel*: a vector of 3d vectors describing the attachment points locations for Points
- *r6RodRel*: a vector<vec6> of 6D vectors describing the attachment points and orientation of 
  each rod.
