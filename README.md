xtnl_MoorDyn_dev
=======

MoorDyn is a lumped-mass mooring dynamics model intended for coupling with floating structure codes. As of 2022 it is available under the BSD 3-Clause license.

More information about MoorDyn is now available at moordyn.readthedocs.io

Note:
This is a private version of the public Moordyn repo for internal use and modification. As it is a cloned version of the public repo, the branch structure from that repo is intact. As of 6/28/2022, this means that the most up-to-date branch is the branch named __dev__, hence the suffix on the end of this repo-name. In the future, we may merge these changes into main. This note should be changed to reflect that.
